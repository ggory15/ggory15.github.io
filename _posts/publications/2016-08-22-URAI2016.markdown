### Abstact 
In this paper, it is investigated how a humanoid can
be controlled from a human motion in a tele-operation system.
The proposed method is based on Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNN) to extract features in nonlinear sequential data. Therefore,
our proposed RNN model can extract the features of the relation
between a human and a robot, and generate motion in a robot
using these features. Also, by regarding the balancing state of the
robot, the robotâ€™s joints corresponding the operator is modified
for stable contact against the ground. The effectiveness of the
proposed new mapping algorithm is verified through simulations.
