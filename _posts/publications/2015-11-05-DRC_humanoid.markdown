### Abstact 
This paper presents the technical approaches in-
cluding the system architecture and the controllers that have
been used by Team SNU at the DARPA Robotics Challenge
(DRC) Finals 2015. The platform THORMANG we used is a
modular humanoid robot developed by ROBOTIS. On top of
this platform, Team SNU developed the iris camera module
and the end effector with passive palm in order to increase
success rate of the tasks at the DRC Finals. Also, we developed
the software architecture to operate the robot intuitively,
in spite of degraded communication. The interface enables
operator to select sensor data to be communicated during each
task. These efforts on the hardware and the software reduce
operation time of the tasks, and increase reliability of the robot.
Finally, the controllers for THORMANG were developed to
consider stability as the first priority, because the humanoid
robot for rescue should perform complex tasks in unexpected
environments. The proposed approaches were verified at the
DRC Finals 2015, where Team SNU ranked 12th place out of
23 teams.
