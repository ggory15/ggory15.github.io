### Abstact 
In this paper, it is investigated how a robot hand can be
controlled from a human motion and an EMG signal in a tele-operation
system. The proposed method uses a tensor to represent a multi-factor
model relevant to different individuals and motions in multiple dimen-
sions. Therefore, the synergies extracted by the proposed algorithm can
account for not only various grasping motions but also the different char-
acteristics of different people. Moreover, a synergy-level controller which
generates motion and force of the robot is developed with postural syner-
gies and an EMG signal. The effectiveness of the proposed new mapping
algorithm is verified through experiments, which demonstrate better rep-
resentation of hand motions with synergies and greater performance on
grasping tasks than those of conventional synergy-based algorithms.
