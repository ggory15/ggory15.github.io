### Abstact 
In this paper, it is investigated how a robot hand can be
controlled from a human motion and an EMG signal in a tele-operation
system. The proposed method uses a tensor to represent a multi-factor
model relevant to different individuals and motions in multiple dimensions. Therefore, the synergies extracted by the proposed algorithm can
account for not only various grasping motions but also the different characteristics of different people. Moreover, a synergy-level controller which
generates motion and force of the robot is developed with postural synergies and an EMG signal. The effectiveness of the proposed new mapping
algorithm is verified through experiments, which demonstrate better representation of hand motions with synergies and greater performance on
grasping tasks than those of conventional synergy-based algorithms.
