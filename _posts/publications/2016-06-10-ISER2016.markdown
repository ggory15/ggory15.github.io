### Abstact 
This paper presents an application of a robot manipulator to
perform Cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) in emergency situations.
CPR is one of the most important treatments which serves to save pa-
tients in cardiac arrest. The proposed robot CPR system attempts to
overcome the limitations of current CPR methods in two aspects. First,
it can provide much more consistent CPR than humans in terms of
strength and timing. Second, biological data of a patient can be used
to determine the best compression point during CPR. The feasibility of
the proposed system is demonstrated through experiments: one simula-
tion on a mannequin and two animal tests. It is also expected that this
robotic CPR system can be a good platform to investigate many as-
pects of CPR methods and guidelines with accurate measurements and
actions.
