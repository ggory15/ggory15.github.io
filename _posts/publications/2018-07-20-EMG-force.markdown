### Abstact 
Grasping force estimation using surface Electromyography(sEMG) has been actively investigated because
it can provide manipulability and dexterity to a prosthetic hand and a robot hand. Most of the current works in
this area focused only on finding the relationship between sEMG signals and grasping force without consider-
ing arm postures. Therefore, regression models of these studies are not suitable for predicting grip force in vari-
ous arm postures. In this paper, it is investigated how grasping force can be predicted from sEMG signals and
various grasping postures. The proposed algorithm uses a tensor algebra to train a multi-factor model relevant
to sEMG signals corresponding to various grasping forces and postures of the wrist and the forearm in multiple
dimensions. The multi-factor model is then decomposed into the four independent factor spaces for the grasp-
ing force, sEMG signals, wrist posture, and forearm posture. Moreover, when a participant takes a new posture,
new factors for the wrist and forearm are interpolated in factor spaces. Thus, the grasping force with the various
posture can be predicted by combining these factors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified
through experiments with five healthy subjects, which demonstrate better performance on grasping force pre-
diction than that of the multi variable regression algorithm.
