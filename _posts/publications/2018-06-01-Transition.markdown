### Abstact 
This paper proposes a unified framework that overcomes four motion constraints including
joint limit, kinematic singularity, algorithmic singularity and obstacles. The proposed framework is
based on our previous works which can insert or remove tasks continuously using activation
parameters and be applied to avoid joint limit and singularity. Additionally, we develop a method for
avoiding obstacles and combine it into the framework to consider four motion constraints
simultaneously. The performance of the proposed framework was demonstrated by simulation tests
with considering four motion constraints. Results of the simulations verified the framework’s
effectiveness near joint limit, kinematic singularity, algorithmic singularity and obstacles. We also
analyzed sensitivity of our algorithm near singularity when using closed loop inverse kinematics
depending on magnitude of gain matrix.
