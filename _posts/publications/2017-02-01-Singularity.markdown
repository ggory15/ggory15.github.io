### Abstact 
Using an inverse of the geometric Jacobian matrix is one of the most popular ways to control robot manipulators, because the Jacobian matrix contains the relationship between joint space velocities and operational space velocities. However, the control algorithm based on Jacobian matrix has algorithmic singularities: The robot manipulator becomes unstable when the Jacobian matrix loses rank. To solve this problem, various methods such as damped and filtered inverse have been proposed, but comparative studies to evaluate the performance of these algorithms are insufficient. Thus, this paper deals with a comparative analysis of six representative singularity avoidance algorithms: Damped Pseudo Inverse, Error Damped Pseudo Inverse, Scaled Jacobian Transpose, Selectively Damped Inverse, Filtered Inverse, and Task Transition Method. Especially, these algorithms are verified through computer simulations with a virtual model of a humanoid robot, THORMANG, in order to evaluate tracking error, computational time, and multiple task performance. With the experimental results, this paper contains a deep discussion about the effectiveness and limitations of each algorithm.
