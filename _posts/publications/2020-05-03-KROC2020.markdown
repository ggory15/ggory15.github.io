### Abstact 
When handling an object, people usually optimize their pose to ease work load. It is possible because  the  required  joint  torque  to  realize  target  wrench  can  be  changed  bydifferent  joint configurations.  Using  this  property,  we  propose  an  inverse  kinematics  method  to  lessen the joint torque  while  the  robot  handles  an  object.  The  proposed  method  minimizes the norm  of  joint  torque ensuring position and orientation constraintsby using non-linear optimization method. As a result, we could obtain  a  joint  configuration which doesnotviolatethe  constraints  and achievesthe  smaller norm of joint torquethan thatfrom conventional inverse kinematics algorithm.
