### Overview
We made an application of a robot manipulator to perform Cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) in emergency situations.
CPR is one of the most important treatments which serves to save patients in cardiac arrest. The proposed robot CPR system attempts to
overcome the limitations of current CPR methods in two aspects. First, it can provide much more consistent CPR than humans in terms of
strength and timing. Second, biological data of a patient can be used to determine the best compression point during CPR. The feasibility of the proposed system is demonstrated through experiments: one simulation on a mannequin and two animal tests. It is also expected that this robotic CPR system can be a good platform to investigate many aspects of CPR methods and guidelines with accurate measurements and actions.

We collaborated with Seoul National University, College of Medicine.

        <h5> Experiments with pigs </h5>
        <li> Twenty nine experiments were conducted. Sixteen swine were tested by manual CPR and thirteen were tested by the robot CPR. </li>
		<li>As noted in the results of the robot CPR assessment, the expected advantages include not only a high resuscitation rate in clinical practice but also a reduced cost in terms of manpower. </li>
