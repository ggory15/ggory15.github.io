### Abstract
This paper introduces a family of iterative al-
gorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimal control. We
generalize the well-known iLQR algorithm to different multiple-
shooting variants, combining advantages like straight-forward
initialization and a closed-loop forward integration. All al-
gorithms have similar computational complexity, i.e. linear
complexity in the time horizon, and can be derived in the same
computational framework. We compare the full-step variants
of our algorithms and present several simulation examples,
including a high-dimensional underactuated robot subject to
contact switches. Simulation results show that our multiple-
shooting algorithms can achieve faster convergence, better local
contraction rates and much shorter runtimes than classical
iLQR, which makes them a superior choice for nonlinear model
predictive control applications.
