### Abstract
A method is presented for solving the discrete-time finite-horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem sub-
ject  to  auxiliary  linear  equality  constraints,  such  as  fixed  end-point  constraints.  The  method  explicitly  determines  an  affine relationship between the control and state variables, as in standard Riccati recursion, giving rise to feedback control policies
that account for constraints. Since the linearly-constrained LQR problem  arises  commonly  in  robotic  trajectory  optimization,
having a method that can efficiently compute these solutions is important.  We  demonstrate  some  of  the  useful  properties  and
interpretations  of  said  control  policies,  and  we  compare  the computation  time  of  our  method  against  existing  methods.
