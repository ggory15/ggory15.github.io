### Abstract
In this paper, we present a formulation of the col-
lision avoidance constraints that relies on the use of separating
planes instead of a distance function. This formulation has the
advantage  of  being  defined  and  continuously  differentiable  in
every situation. Because it introduces additional variables to the
optimization problems, making it bigger and potentially slowing
down  its  resolution,  we  propose  a  different  resolution  method
that  takes  advantage  of  the  independence  of  the  variables,  to
form  two  subproblems  that  can  be  solved  efficiently  in  an
alternate problem fashion. We present some preliminary results
using  this  approach  in  order  to  highlight  its  potential  and
promises in terms of convergence speed and robustness.
